## Usage

## Translating

`lifesim.pot` is a template for translations. <br />
Copy `lifesim.pot` to a new file, fill in the translations, then upload it as `lifesim.po` in the `locale` folder.<br />
The `.po` should be placed in the directory path `locale/[language code]/LC_MESSAGES`. <br />
I will then convert it to a `.mo` file so it can be translated.

NOTE: The text between the `{}` in strings is used for string formatting, and is not to be translated. Their translations are handled separately.

Translation strings may be need to be updated as new strings are being added.
